main.py currently reads inputs of addresses of one day and one center from file and call clarke_wright.py to determine routing

vrp_lp_formulation.py should also compute routing on a single depot but is extremly slow right now

test.ipynb is a jupiter notebook that plots all customers routes for all depots on both days

All data used is in EAM_data

read_customers reads all the sheets of EAM_data into separate dataframe variables
